When the component mounts (or the page is refreshed), the useEffect hook triggers the fetchData function.
The fetchData function, in turn, calls the fetchUserData function, making an API request to get user data.
While the data is being fetched, the loading state is set to true, indicating that the content is still loading.
Initial Display State:

Once the data is successfully fetched, the setUserData function is called to update the userData state with the fetched data.
The setLoading function is then called to set the loading state to false, indicating that the loading is complete.
The component re-renders, and the user list (userData) is displayed on the screen.
Search State:

When the user types into the search input (searchTerm state), the handleSearch function is called, updating the searchTerm state.
The filteredUsers state is derived from userData based on the search criteria.
The user list (filteredUsers) is updated, and the component re-renders to display the filtered list.
